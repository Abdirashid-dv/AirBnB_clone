# AirBnB Clone - Web Static

This is the first part of the AirBnB clone project. This part is about the HTML/CSS of the project. The main goal of this project is to deploy a simple copy of the AirBnB website. This is the first step to build the front-end. The final result will be a website that shows the places available to rent.
